## BTC FNG prediction 

<br/>

### After creating an 2 layer ltsm RNN to create a closing price prediction using the FNG index I found that it was terribly inaccurate. the prediction stayed fairly stable while the real price was extremely volitiale

### comparatively using the closing price to predict the next price was far more closer to the actual price.
